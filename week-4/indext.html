                            <p>"I had a dog that was just super hyper and bitter.  We tried other training companies, 
                                Pets-R-US was my last hope.  They were incredible, to see my 
                                 dogs face relaxed,happy and following commands, blow my mind. We left feeling empowered and excited to 
                                  take our dog home.  If you are having issues and just can't train your dog I highly 
                                  recommend you take your dog to Pets-R-US.  The Staff is awesome!!""

                                 they're their own. Very friendly and professional, taking time to train staff, 
                                 and the owners are fantastic! Our pups are never in a hurry to leave, they want
                                  to stay and visit their friends (the staff) on the way out. Thank you for giving
